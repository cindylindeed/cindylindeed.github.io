I help Google use cryptography correctly and contribute to
[Tink](https://developers.google.com/tink), an open source cryptography library.

Previously, I worked on
* [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian), a cryptographically verifiable
data store that underpins [Certificate Transparency](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962),
along with related concepts like [Gossip Protocols](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2011.04551),
* [Private Information Retrieval](https://github.com/google/private-retrieval),
and
* DeepMindâ€™s [mobile app for clinicians](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/working-with-the-nhs-to-build-lifesaving-technology/)
in the United Kingdom.

I am an organizer for the [Open Source Cryptography Workshop](https://opensourcecryptowork.shop/),
which is colocated with [Real World Crypto](https://rwc.iacr.org/).

### Education

I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/),
where I did research in the field of bioinformatics at the [Butte](https://buttelab.ucsf.edu/)
and [Sirota](https://sirotalab.ucsf.edu/) Labs, both of which are now located at
the [University of California, San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu/).

### Miscellany

At the moment, I am (slowly) working through a master's degree in Theology and
Literature at the [Graduate Theological Union](https://www.gtu.edu/),
concentrating on Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky.

I enjoy trail running (also slowly) and reading (Borges and Proust are some
other favorites).
