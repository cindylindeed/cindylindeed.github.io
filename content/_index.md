I am currently a software engineer on Google’s cryptography team working
primarily on [Tink](https://developers.google.com/tink), a multi-language, open
source library that provides cryptographic APIs that are secure and hard(er) to misuse.

Previously, I worked on
* [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian), a cryptographically verifiable
data store that underpins [Certificate Transparency](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962),
along with related concepts like [Gossip Protocols](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2011.04551),
* [Private Information Retrieval](https://github.com/google/private-retrieval),
and
* DeepMind’s [mobile app for clinicians](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/working-with-the-nhs-to-build-lifesaving-technology/)
in the United Kingdom.

I am an organizer for the [Open Source Cryptography Workshop](https://opensourcecryptowork.shop/),
which is colocated with [Real World Crypto](https://rwc.iacr.org/).

### Education

I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/),
where I did research in the field of bioinformatics at the [Butte](https://buttelab.ucsf.edu/)
and [Sirota](https://sirotalab.ucsf.edu/) Labs, both of which are now located at
the [University of California, San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu/).

### Miscellany

At the moment, I am (slowly) working through a master's degree in Theology and
Literature at the [Graduate Theological Union](https://www.gtu.edu/), focusing
on polyphony and aesthetics in the traditions of Dostoevsky, Bakhtin, and
Kierkegaard.

I enjoy trail running (also slowly) and reading (in addition to the above,
Borges and Proust are some other favorites).
